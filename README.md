## Overview

AI Checkup is a multilingual AI-powered medical consultation application designed to improve the health and well-being of underprivileged populations worldwide and help bridge the healthcare gap. It aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 3: "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" and the realization of a sustainable society.

This application provides comprehensive features to support users' health management, including multilingual AI-based medical consultations, evidence-based health advice, information on supplements and medicines, guidance to medical institutions when necessary, and personal health record management.

## Features

*   **Multilingual AI-Powered Medical Consultation:** Users can input their symptoms in major languages (English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, etc.), and state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms will analyze the input to infer related health issues and potential diseases.
*   **Evidence-Based Health Advice:** Provides reliable health advice based on guidelines from the WHO and national health authorities.
*   **Supplement and Medicine Information:** Provides information on appropriate supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs tailored to the user's symptoms and region, by linking with databases of approved products in each country.
*   **Guidance to Medical Institutions:** When symptoms are severe or urgent, the app guides users to the nearest medical institutions (public hospitals, NGO-run clinics, etc.).
*   **Health Record Management:** Securely stores consultation results, health advice, medication information, and medical visit history, allowing users to continuously track their health status.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Enables the use of essential features offline to accommodate regions with unstable internet connectivity.

## Strengths

*   **Global Vision and Localization:** Tailors the service to the specific language, culture, healthcare environment, and lifestyle of each region.
*   **Reliable Partnerships:** Collaborates with the WHO, Doctors Without Borders, national health ministries, and major medical NGOs to provide reliable information and reach a wide range of users.
*   **Cutting-Edge AI Technology and Data Utilization:** Develops and improves highly accurate consultation algorithms, utilizes user-collected data to improve AI accuracy, enhance services, and identify public health challenges.
*   **Scalability and Sustainability:** Leverages a cloud-based platform and open-source technologies to deliver services at a low cost and enable rapid global expansion.
